  <h2>Understanding Anxiety and Its Impact</h2>
  <p>
    Anxiety is a natural response to stress—but when it’s persistent or excessive, it can interfere with sleep, relationships, work, and overall well‑being. 
    Anxiety disorders are among the most treatable by <strong>therapy services</strong>, especially when working with a <strong>mental health expert</strong> specializing in anxiety treatment.
  </p>
  <p>
    The most effective care often combines evidence-based modalities, including:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT)</strong> – Helps identify and change negative thinking patterns.</li>
    <li><strong>Exposure Therapy</strong> – Gradually reduces fear and avoidance behaviors.</li>
    <li><strong>Acceptance and Commitment Therapy (ACT)</strong> – Encourages mindfulness and acceptance of thoughts.</li>
    <li><strong>Mindfulness-Based Approaches</strong> – Improves present-moment awareness and emotional regulation.</li>
  </ul>
